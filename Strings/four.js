4. Multiline String

Take the following rhyme:


A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!

How can you assign this string to a single variable, preserving the line break?




*/

let firstStr = "A pirate I was meant to be!";
let secondStr = "Trim the sails and roam the sea!";

console.log(firstStr + "\n" + secondStr);

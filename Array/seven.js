7. Equality

Predict the output of the below code. When you run the code, do you see what you expected? Why or why not?

let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = [2, 6, 4];

console.log(array1 === array2);


*/

// These arrays are not equal as they point to different places in memory, therefore boolean false is printed

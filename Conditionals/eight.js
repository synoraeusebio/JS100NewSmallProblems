Exercise 8. Logical Conditions 2

Problem: 

Predict the output of the following code:

if (true && false) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No...');
}

*/

No...is printed to the console. The And Operator is the opposite of the Or Operator. And will return true if both are true and false if either are false.

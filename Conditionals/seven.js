Exercise 7. Logical Conditions 1

Problem: 

Predict the output of the following code:

if (false || true) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No...');
}

*/

Yes! is printed to the console. The Or Operator will return true if either operand is true. False is returned when both are false. This is different from the And Operator where true is returned when both are true, false when either are false.
